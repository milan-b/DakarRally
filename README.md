# DakarRally

## Technical Interview Test Assignment

### Run

Run project from a command shell:

```
cd DakarRally/DakarRally
dotnet run
```

```Dakar Rally.postman_collection.json``` is postman collection which you can use to try out endpoints.

### Notes
	* If system goes down while simulation is running, simulation will continue to execute when system gets up again.
	* I didn't have a time to write tests.
